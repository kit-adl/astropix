# Astropix Firmware
The firmware has to be programmed first!  
Please see the [Nexys Programming Guide](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/nexys-video-programming-guide/start) for detailed instructions on USB, SD or Flash programming.

Maybe it would make sense to make an FPGA bit file release otherwise:

- The project is pushed with Vivado 2020.1 version config files, use this version to avoid warnings and IP block updates 
- The project is located under GECCO_Firmware
